1.	INTRODUCTION 
This document is a response to the brief submitted by Paddy Evans. It presents a high level view of the main system functionality along with some sample screen layouts to facilitate better understanding of the proposed solution. Acceptance of this document by the sponsor will initiate a formal system development project that will be designed and built according to prevailing company standards. 

2.	PRODUCT DECRIPTION 
2.1	 SCOPE
The product is intended to be a standalone, single page application that is designed to be mobile first, but work equally as well on desktops. The application will allow the user to manipulate the database using a simple interface which connects front-end components to server side endpoints to achieve this result. An example of the typical functionality is shown in the diagram below:  




2.2	 PRODUCT FEATURES 
The application will be developed using the following:
•	HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Bootstrap framework)
•	PHP (JSON data interchange)
•	MariaDB (Create, Read, Edit and Delete). 
The wireframe model below demonstrates the proposed layout and functionality:
 
 
 

 
3.	Development
3.1	Development Tools
As per instruction of Paddy, this languages will be used to implement the project:
•	HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/Bootstrap/JQuery
•	PHP for the backend JSON data interchange 
•	MySQL 
•	MariaDB
•	AJAX


3.2	 Development Environment
I will be Microsoft Visual Studio code editor, and XAMPP as this will be my local server. XAMPP and visual studio are both open source and free. XAMPP consists of interpreters for scripts written in PHP/PERL.
I will be making use of Relation database management and the language for achieving that will be MySQL. MariaDB will be used to manage data in database in accordance to user actions CRUD.
3.3	 Developing Front End
Initially, I will find all the elements from the wireframe, the color-scheme and etc., will be revised at later stages and will be changed. But as I am developing, I will keep responsiveness in mind for all devices and screen sizes. 
Upon completion of this stage, the table for employee, with the menu bar, should be ready. And waiting for the dynamic data from the database.
3.4	 Developing Back-end
To perform CRUD operation, I will create an AJAX POST request to the PHP files and JQuery to manipulate the DOM elements on the HTML page. 
Adding employee will be in a php file which the AJAX will send POST requests to. Each section (department, location, and employee) will have its own CRUD operation and consequently its php files for those operation, and AJAX functions making post requests to those php files. 
I will make use of Live search to ensure that the page doesn’t reload and interfere with an ongoing operation or half filled forms. 
 

Acceptance of this document will initiate the development of the system.
